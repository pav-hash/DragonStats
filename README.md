# DragonStats

This is designed to be run under linux with either apache or nginx.  The machine could
be as simple as a raspberry pi!

Simply place all the files into a web enabled directory.
Once that is done, open up a browser and go to:  http://yourdomain.com/dragonstats.php

The first time the stats page runs, it will auto-scan your entire /24 subnet looking
for your miners.  The auto-scan process takes between 5-20 seconds depending upon how
many computers, miners, printers, etc. are on your network.

If you add more miners to your local farm, or remove them, simply press the green 
'Rescan Network' button, and the page will refresh with all your currently alive miners.
NOTE: this will NOT find dead or unresponsive miners, so make sure all your miners are
up and running.  Otherwise, once you get them all running 'Rescan Network'.
