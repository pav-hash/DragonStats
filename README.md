Simply place all the files into a web enabled directory.
Once that is done, open up a browser and go to:  http://yourdomain.com/dragonstats.php

The first time the stats page runs, it will auto-scan your entire /24 subnet looking
for your miners.  The auto-scan process takes between 5-20 seconds depending upon how
many computers, miners, printers, etc. are on your network.
